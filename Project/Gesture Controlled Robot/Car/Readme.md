## Figures

### Acceleration and Deceleration Concept
This figure shows how the car changes speed in a controlled way. It explains when the system increases the motor speed and when it slows down, based on the driving situation and the control command.

### Overall System Block Diagram
This figure gives the full system overview. It shows the main parts of the project and how data moves between them, from the sensor inputs and control logic to the motor driver and the car movement.

### Motor Control Concept
This figure explains the motor control idea. It shows how the speed command is converted into a motor drive signal, and how the controller adjusts the motor output to reach the target speed.

### Line Following Logic
This figure shows the decision rules for line following. It explains how the IR sensors detect the line and how the system decides to go straight, turn left, or turn right based on the sensor readings.
